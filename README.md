# Ex2_OOP
# Info

The whole project is a game based on the OOP course. the main goal of the game is to "catch" all the pokemons on field. The game has 24 different levels containing different amount of agents and have different amount of time to play(some maps are 30seconds long and some are 60seconds long). The job that the agents have is to catch the pokemon who spawn randomaly on the edges of a directional weighted graph The game itself isnt manual but automatic and we had to write an algorithm so the agents will pick as many high value pokemons at the shortest amount of moves.
